## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and use a neural network-based image classifier. The trained model can:
- Classify images of flowers into various species based on a provided dataset.
- Display the top K predictions with their respective probabilities.
- Map predicted indices to actual flower names for better interpretability.

The project was developed to showcase my skills in:
- Deep learning with PyTorch.
- Building and training neural networks.
- Implementing image preprocessing pipelines.
- Deploying machine learning models for inference.

## Features

- **Pre-Trained Model:** Leverages a transfer learning approach using models like VGG or ResNet.
- **Top-K Predictions:** Displays the top K predicted categories along with probabilities.
- **Category Mapping:** Converts indices to human-readable flower names.
- **GPU Support:** Allows inference on GPU for faster computation.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- Argparse
